You are building a Swift-based AUV3 MIDI plugin for iOS called ThreadSpace.

It must:
- Support multiple plugin instances in a host like AUM
- Route MIDI from one instance to multiple synths or tracks
- Accept natural language descriptions from a user to generate MIDI, automation, or modulations
- Interface with an external AI companion for higher-order control
- Be modular and clean for Blackbox to assist in extending it

Use Swift + AudioUnit + AUv3 APIs. UI can be SwiftUI or UIKit. Focus on musical utility and novel interactions.
